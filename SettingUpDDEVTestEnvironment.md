Setting up DDEV and a test Drupal instance on your Windows laptop is fairly straightforward. Here's a quick and easy guide to get you started:

##Step 1: Install WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
DDEV requires WSL 2 to run on Windows, so if you don't have it installed yet, follow these steps:

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```
wsl --install
```
This installs WSL with Ubuntu as the default Linux distribution. Restart your system if needed.

Set WSL 2 as the default version:
In the same PowerShell terminal, type:
```
wsl --set-default-version 2
```
Verify the installation by typing:

In the same PowerShell terminal, type:
```
wsl -l -v
```
##Step 2: Install Docker Desktop
Download and install Docker Desktop for Windows from Docker's official site.

During the installation, make sure to enable the option for WSL 2 backend.

After installation, open Docker Desktop and go to Settings > Resources > WSL Integration.

Enable integration with your Ubuntu WSL instance (or other distros).
Start Docker Desktop and make sure it is running.

##Step 3: Install DDEV
Open your WSL 2 terminal (e.g., Ubuntu).

Run the following commands to install DDEV:
Download the DDEV installation script:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drud/ddev/master/scripts/install_ddev.sh
```
Make the script executable and run it:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
chmod +x install_ddev.sh
./install_ddev.sh
```
After installation, verify DDEV is installed by running:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
ddev version
```
##Step 4: Set Up a Test Drupal Instance

In your WSL 2 terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to set up your Drupal project, e.g., in your home directory:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
cd ~
mkdir drupal-test
cd drupal-test
```
Run the following DDEV commands to create a Drupal instance:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
ddev config --project-type=drupal10 --docroot=web --create-docroot
ddev start
```
DDEV will generate a ddev directory and a configuration file. Now, install Drupal using Composer:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
ddev composer create "drupal/recommended-project"
```
Once the installation is complete, run:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
ddev drush site:install
```
You’ll be prompted for some site setup info, such as the site name, admin username, and password.

If you have an error saying you're not running the right version of PHP, do these steps:


###Fix Step 1: Check Available PHP Versions in DDEV
DDEV supports PHP versions such as 8.0, 8.1, and 8.2. You can verify this by checking the DDEV documentation, but usually these versions are preinstalled and ready to be used in your project.

###Fix Step 2: Update the PHP Version in DDEV
Navigate to your project folder in the terminal:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
cd ~/drupal-test  # or wherever your DDEV project folder is
```
Edit your DDEV config file to specify the desired PHP version. This is done by modifying the config.yaml file:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
nano .ddev/config.yaml
```
Look for the line that specifies the PHP version. If it’s not there, add it under the #webimage section. Here’s an example of how it should look:
The secion should look like this:
```
webimage:
  type: php
  version: "8.2"
```
Save and exit the file (Ctrl + X, then Y to confirm saving, and press Enter).

###Fix Step 3: Restart DDEV
After updating the configuration, restart your DDEV environment for the changes to take effect.
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
ddev restart
```
DDEV will now use the new PHP version (in this case, PHP 8.2).

###Fix Step 4: Verify PHP Version
Once your environment has restarted, verify that the PHP version has been updated by running the following command:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
ddev php --version
```
You should now see that the correct PHP version is active in your DDEV environment.

###Fix Step 5: Retry Installing Drush
Now that your PHP version is upgraded, try running your Drush commands again:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
ddev drush --version
```
###Fix Step 6: Re-Run the drush site install
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
ddev drush site:install
```
You’ll be prompted for some site setup info, such as the site name, admin username, and password.

##Step 5: Access Your Test Drupal Site
After the installation, DDEV will tell you the URL to access the site locally (usually something like http://drupal-test.ddev.site).
Open the provided URL in your browser, and you'll see your test Drupal instance up and running.

##Step 6: Stop and Restart Your Project
To stop the environment, simply run:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
ddev stop
```
To start it again, navigate back to your project directory and run:
In the WSL 2/Ubuntu terminal, type:
```
ddev start
```
Now you have a test Drupal instance running on your Windows laptop using DDEV, Docker, and WSL 2! This setup is perfect for local development without cluttering your main environment. Let me know if you hit any snags or need help customizing your setup further!
