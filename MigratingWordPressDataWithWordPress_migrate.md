# Migrating WordPress Data with the WordPress_Migrate module
This module leverages Drupal’s Migrate API to directly import WordPress data, such as posts, pages, categories, tags, and even user accounts. Here’s a step-by-step guide to use this approach:

## Step 1: Prepare the WordPress Export File
In WordPress, go to Tools > Export.
Select "All content" to export everything or specific content types if you prefer.
Download the export file (usually named wordpress.xml).

## Step 2: Install Required Modules
Install the Migrate modules (Migrate, Migrate Plus, Migrate Tools) in Drupal. You can do this with Composer:
```
composer require drupal/migrate_plus drupal/migrate_tools
```
Install WordPress Migrate module:
```
composer require drupal/wordpress_migrate
```
Enable the modules:
Go to Extend in the Drupal admin UI and enable Migrate, Migrate Plus, Migrate Tools, and WordPress Migrate.

## Step 3: Configure the Migration
The WordPress Migrate module has pre-configured migration templates that map WordPress data to Drupal structures.
In Drupal, go to Structure > Migrations
Click the "+Add Import From WordPress" button and you will be prompted to browse for your exported XML file and input the base URL from the WordPress blog from which you exported your data.  Then, click Next.
You will be prompted to select several items to import and how to map them to the new Drupal installation.  
If you don't have a custom content block for Blog or something similar, just use the predefined Article block.  Also, some versions may have issues importing WordPress tags and categories, so be aware of that.

## Step 4:  Run the Migration:
Use Drush (Drupal’s command-line interface) to execute the migration. Open a terminal and run the following commands:
```
drush migrate:status
```
This lists all available migrations. Look for migrations prefixed with "WordPress" (e.g., wordpress_posts, wordpress_comments).
Import the Content:
You can look at your migrations again and click the Execute tab to exectue the import, or use drush below.

Run the following command to import all WordPress data at once:
```
drush migrate:import --all
```
Alternatively, run specific migrations (e.g., just posts or users) by referencing the migration ID:
```
drush migrate:import wordpress_posts
drush migrate:import wordpress_users
```
## Step 5: Review and Verify the Imported Content
Go to Content > Content in your Drupal admin panel to review your imported posts.
Users can be reviewed under People.
Tags and Categories should appear as Taxonomy terms.
## Step 6: Map Custom Fields (Optional)
If you have custom fields in WordPress, you may need to extend the migration configuration files located in modules/contrib/wordpress_migrate/config/install/. This can require custom development if you have complex data structures.
