# Drupal Documentation for Absolute Beginners
This is just a small, personal collection of Drupal documentation that I'm putting together to stay organized.  I'm offering it up to anyone looking for simplified help.  I've worked in IT for over 30 years, but I still need to break things down into simple steps to accomplish anything significant.
My intention is to collect the documents I use to set up a local and online test environment and eventually migrate several websites from either a mix of plain HTML and WordPress or sites entirely contained in WordPress to Drupal.

The documentation is CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, aka Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International, which means you can use it and share it for non-commercial use as long as you give me credit.  Any code examples will be under the license they were released under, which for Drupal is the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or later.


I highly recommend that you use the WordPress_Migrate module found at https://www.drupal.org/project/wordpress_migrate to migrate your data.
